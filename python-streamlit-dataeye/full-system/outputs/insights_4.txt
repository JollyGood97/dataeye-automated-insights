Analyze the schema and think of an interesting insight question.\n    2. Come up with a set of sub questions to use db-agent-tool to get answers from the table. DONT try to make up or hallucinate answers on your own.\n    3. Ask db-agent-tool to a sub question. Once you get the response, remember it, and ask the next sub question. Continue until you collect answers for all your sub questions.\n    4. Interpret the tool\'s responses to form your insights.\n    5. Recommend the best chart type for visualizing each insight and provide the reasoning for choosing the chart type. Give all chart parameters required to make the chart in the future.\n    6. Finally, present everything as a JSON array of objects as shown below.\n    Here is an example JSON format for your final output:\n    ```json[\n    {\n        "insight_question": "The insight you explored goes here.  eg: What is the average marks for Math?",\n        "questions_and_answers_from_tool": \n        [ {"question": "Your sub question 1 here. eg: What is the average marks for Math in Term 1?", \n        "answer": "The response returned by invoking the db-agent-tool goes here." }, ... //continue adding your sub question objects here],\n        "summary": "Summary of the useful insight, after getting the answers through the db-agent-tool.
