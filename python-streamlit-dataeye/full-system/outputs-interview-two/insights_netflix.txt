{'input': ' \n    Here is the database schema: [(0, \'show_id\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (1, \'type\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (2, \'title\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (3, \'director\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (4, \'cast\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (5, \'country\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (6, \'date_added\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (7, \'release_year\', \'INTEGER\', 0, None, 0), (8, \'rating\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (9, \'duration\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (10, \'listed_in\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0), (11, \'description\', \'TEXT\', 0, None, 0)].\n    Here are the categorical columns and their values: {\n  "type": [\n    "Movie",\n    "TV Show"\n  ]\n}.\nAlways use the "db-agent-tool" tool to query the database and get answers where required. DO NOT HALLUCINATE or try to make up your own database.\nAvoid querying all the data as you have a token limit. You need to intelligently ask the questions from the "db-agent-tool".\n    Your task is to uncover 03 valuable insights and identify areas for improvement if any for the organization. \n    Please organize your insights and give the final output as a JSON array of 03 insight objects. \n\n    Here\'s how you should proceed:\n\nStep 1:  Use the "db-agent-tool" tool to analyze the database, paying special attention to identified table, its categorical columns and their values. \nConsider how these elements can interact and reveal trends, patterns, or anomalies and come up with a useful insight question.\n   Step 2. Ask natural language questions one by one from the "db-agent-tool" tool to get data from the database to get the answers to your insight question. DONT try to make up or hallucinate answers on your own.\n    Step 3. Interpret the tool\'s responses and summarize your findings.\n    Step 4. Recommend the best chart type for visualizing each insight and provide the reasoning for choosing the chart type. Give all chart parameters required to make the chart in the future.\n    Also add all the data required to generate the chart. Use the "db-agent-tool" tool to get the data required for the chart.\n    Step 5. Finally, present your findings as a JSON array of comma separated objects as shown below. The array should consist of 03 insight objects that delve into different aspects of the data.\n    Here is an example JSON format for your final output:\n    ```json[\n    {\n        "insight_question": "The insight you explored goes here.  eg: What is the average marks for Math?",\n        "questions_and_answers_from_tool": \n        [ {"question": "Your sub question 1 here. eg: What is the average marks for Math in Term 1?", \n        "answer": "Use the "db-agent-tool" tool and put its output here. eg: 52.5}, ... //continue adding your sub questions and the answers here],\n        "summary": "Summary of the useful insight, after getting the answers through the db-agent-tool.
