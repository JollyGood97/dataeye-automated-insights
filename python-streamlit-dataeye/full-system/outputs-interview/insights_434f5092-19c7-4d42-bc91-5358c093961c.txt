After analyzing the initial data and responses from the `db-agent-tool`, here are the insights derived from the dataset:

1. **Overview of Database Content and Output Case Distribution**
   - The database contains a total of 5184 records.
   - The distribution of "Output Case" values shows a significant predominance of the 'Modal' output case, constituting the majority with 3456 instances. Other output cases like 'Wind X', 'Live', 'Dead', and 'Comb4' are relatively less frequent, each with 288 instances.

2. **Output Case Impact on Load and Moment Values**
   - Upon examining average load and moment values ('P (kN)', 'V2 (kN)', 'V3 (kN)', 'T (kN-m)', 'M2 (kN-m)', and 'M3 (kN-m)') across different 'Output Cases', it's evident that 'Comb2' generally leads to higher values, indicating potentially more significant structural demands.
   - The 'Modal' output case has the lowest average values across all metrics, suggesting minimal structural impact in this scenario.

These insights can guide further detailed analysis on structural demands under various loading conditions and inform decision-making for design, safety assessment, or optimization of structural elements.
