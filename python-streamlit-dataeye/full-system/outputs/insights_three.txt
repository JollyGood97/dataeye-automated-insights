{'input': '\n        As a data analyst equipped with an SQL Agent tool, you have access to a database schema and sample data outlined here: \nCREATE TABLE "MARKS" (\n\t"Student_Name" TEXT, \n\t"Subject" TEXT, \n\t"Marks_out_of_100" INTEGER, \n\t"Term" INTEGER\n)\n\n/*\n3 rows from MARKS table:\nStudent_Name\tSubject\tMarks_out_of_100\tTerm\nJack\tMath\t90\t1\nJohn\tMath\t60\t1\nMary\tMath\t70\t1\n*/. Additionally, you\'re aware of categorical columns and their values: {\n  "Student_Name": [\n    "Jack",\n    "John",\n    "Mary",\n    "Peter",\n    "Bob"\n  ],\n  "Subject": [\n    "Math",\n    "English",\n    "Science"\n  ],\n  "Term": [\n    1,\n    2\n  ]\n}. Your objective is to derive actionable insights from the this dataset to identify potential areas for improvement or interesting trends for an organization or an entity.\n\n        To achieve this, follow these steps:\n\n        1. Analyze the provided schema and sample data, with a focus on the interactions between categorical columns and their values. Identify potential trends, patterns, or anomalies that could offer valuable insights.\n\n        2. Generate a set of insightful questions based on your analysis. These questions should aim to uncover significant trends, comparisons between categories, or unique data characteristics.\n\n        3. For each question, utilize the SQL Agent tool to execute relevant SQL queries against the MARKS table. Ensure to capture and include the query results directly within your response.\n\n        4. Summarize your findings in a structured JSON array format, detailing each insight along with the SQL query results that support it. The JSON object should include:\n        - The \'insight_question\' describing the main observation or query.\n        - The \'sql_result\' containing data retrieved via SQL queries that substantiate the insight.\n        - An \'assumption\' made during the analysis, if applicable.\n        - The \'visualization_chart\' recommended for presenting the findings, accompanied by \'reasoning\' for its choice.\n\n        Structure your output as follows:\n      {\n        "insight_question": "What is the specific insight being explored?",\n        "sql_result": "Data retrieved from the SQL Agent Tool",\n        "assumption": "Any underlying assumptions for this analysis",\n        "visualization_chart": "Suggested type of chart for visualization",\n        "reasoning": "Explanation for choosing this chart type"\n        // Repeat this structure for each insight identified.\n       \n      }\n\n        Your insights should span various aspects of the data, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview that can inform strategic decisions for the organization.\n        ', 'output': "Based on the provided database schema and sample data, I will analyze the interactions between categorical columns and their values to derive actionable insights.
