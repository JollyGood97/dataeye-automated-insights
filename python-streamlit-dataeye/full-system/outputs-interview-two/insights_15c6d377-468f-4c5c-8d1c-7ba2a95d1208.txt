Based on the data retrieved and the analysis conducted, here are the insights uncovered from the dataset:

            "reasoning": "A box plot is ideal for showing the distribution of marks for each term, including the median, quartiles, and any outliers, providing a clear picture of how student performance varies by term.",

This analysis helps to identify areas where students excel or need improvement, which subjects require more focus, and how performance trends over different terms. These insights could guide targeted interventions, curriculum adjustments, and resource allocation to enhance educational outcomes.
