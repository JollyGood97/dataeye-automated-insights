The analysis of the database revealed the following insights:

1. **Distribution of Entries Across Stories**
   - The database has an equal distribution of entries across Story6, Story5, Story4, Story3, and Story2, with each Story having 864 entries. This indicates a balanced data collection across different levels of the structure being analyzed.
   
2. **Distribution of 'Output Case' Across the Database**
   - The 'Output Case' is predominantly 'Modal' with 3,456 entries, followed by 'Wind X', 'Live', 'Dead', and 'Comb4', each having 288 entries. This distribution highlights a focus on modal analysis cases over other types of output cases.

3. **Entries Distribution by 'Case Type'**
   - The entries are mostly 'LinModEigen' with 3,456 entries, indicating a significant emphasis on modal eigenvalue analysis. 'LinStatic' and 'Combination' case types follow with 864 entries each, showing less focus on static linear and combination cases.

4. **Average 'P (kN)' and 'M2 (kN-m)' Values Across Stories**
   - The average 'P (kN)' decreases as we move from Story1 (356.66 kN) to Story5 (117.35 kN), showing a trend of decreasing axial force with height in the structure.
   - The average 'M2 (kN-m)' values are relatively low and vary slightly across different stories, with the highest average in Story6 (8.77 kN-m) and the lowest in Story5 (5.58 kN-m). This suggests a variation in moment forces applied across different stories.

Based on these insights, the recommendations for visualizations are as follows:

1. **For the Distribution of Entries Across Stories**
   - **Chart Type:** Bar Chart
   - **Reasoning:** A bar chart is suitable for comparing the number of entries across different stories, providing a clear visual of the balanced data distribution.
   - **Parameters:** x_axis: 'Stories', y_axis: 'Number of Entries', title: 'Distribution of Entries Across Stories', colors: varied per story.
   - **Chart Data:** `{"Story6": 864, "Story5": 864, "Story4": 864, "Story3": 864, "Story2": 864}`

2. **For the Distribution of 'Output Case' Across the Database**
   - **Chart Type:** Pie Chart
   - **Reasoning:** A pie chart effectively represents the proportion of each 'Output Case' type within the database, highlighting the dominance of 'Modal' cases.
   - **Parameters:** labels: 'Output Case', values: 'Number of Entries', title: 'Distribution of Output Cases'.
   - **Chart Data:** `{"Modal": 3456, "Wind X": 288, "Live": 288, "Dead": 288, "Comb4": 288}`

3. **For the Entries Distribution by 'Case Type'**
   - **Chart Type:** Bar Chart
   - **Reasoning:** A bar chart clearly illustrates the number of entries for each 'Case Type', emphasizing the preference for 'LinModEigen'.
   - **Parameters:** x_axis: 'Case Type', y_axis: 'Number of Entries', title: 'Entries Distribution by Case Type', colors: varied per case type.
   - **Chart Data:** `{"LinModEigen": 3456, "LinStatic": 864, "Combination": 864}`

4. **For Average 'P (kN)' and 'M2 (kN-m)' Values Across Stories**
   - **Chart Type:** Line Chart
   - **Reasoning:** A line chart is chosen for its ability to show trends over the stories, such as the decrease in 'P (kN)' and the variation in 'M2 (kN-m)'.
   - **Parameters:** x_axis: 'Stories', y_axis: 'Average Value', title: 'Average P (kN) and M2 (kN-m) Across Stories', colors: ['P (kN)', 'M2 (kN-m)'].
   - **Chart Data:** `{"Stories": ["Story1", "Story2", "Story3", "Story4", "Story5"], "P (kN)": [356.66, 296.66, 236.71, 176.94, 117.35], "M2 (kN-m)": [8.77, 6.35, 6.02, 5.82, 5.58]}`
