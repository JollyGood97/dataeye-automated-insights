        ],
        "summary": "The average marks indicate that Math has the highest average score among the subjects, followed by English and Science. This suggests that students perform best in Math and may need additional support in Science, which has the lowest average.",

        "summary": "The distribution of marks shows a significant improvement from Term 1 to Term 2, with average marks increasing from 60.4 to 71. This suggests that students' performance has improved over time, or that the curriculum or teaching methods were more effective in Term 2.",
