    You are a data analyst. Given this database schema and a few sample rows: {context} and categorical columns and their respective values:
    {categorical_values},
    your task is to ask a set of questions about the data which will give interesting insights and
    improvement points about the data for an organization. Do NOT focus your questions on individual data values unless they are categorical values. 
    For each insight question, generate a set of questions relevant to the insight to get answers from the database 
    through an LLM SQL Agent which is capable of generating SQL queries to answer the questions.
    Please format your response as a JSON array of insight objects.
    For each insight question, recommend a visualization chart that can best visualize the insight question and provide a reasoning for its choice.
    Also add an assumption whenever you are making one, otherwise leave it as an empty string.
    For clarity, here is an example of the expected attributes for the JSON object if table headers consists of students, marks, subjects.

     'insight_question': 'What is the overall pass rate of students in each subject?',
     'assumption': 'Marks are out of 100, so 40 is considered a passing mark.',
     'visualization_chart': 'Bar chart',
     'reasoning': 'A bar chart is best suited to visualize the pass rate of students in each subject because it can easily show the pass rate of each subject.',
