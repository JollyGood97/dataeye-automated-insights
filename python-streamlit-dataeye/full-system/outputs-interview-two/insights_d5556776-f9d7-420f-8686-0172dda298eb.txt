It seems there is a persistent issue with accessing the database, as the error message suggests an attempt to query a table named "ELEMENT_FORCES", which does not match the intended query or the schema provided. This discrepancy indicates a technical error in querying the database.

Given the provided database schema, which outlines a structure for storing data related to heroes, their pick rates, win/loss records, and other statistics, the intention was to query this specific dataset. However, the error encountered suggests a misalignment with the database's actual structure or an issue with the query execution process.

Unfortunately, without the ability to directly query the correct table and retrieve data, it's challenging to proceed with generating insights based on the dataset. The error encountered prevents the execution of queries that would allow for the analysis of hero performance, pick rates, win rates, and other metrics that could offer valuable insights. 

In the absence of direct access to the data due to the error, I'm unable to fulfill the request for generating insights from the dataset.
